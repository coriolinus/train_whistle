# Train Whistle

## Why?

Every Factorio player has experienced it: you're minding your own business, thinking of how you're 
going to expand your operation, when suddenly the game over screen pops up. What just happened?

You crossed the tracks without looking, and got annihilated by a train.

This mod ends to end that sort of thing in a simple, easy way.

## How?

The train looks ahead. Based on its speed and pathing, if the player is near the track where it'll
be in the next few seconds, it toots. If the player is actually on the track where it'll be in that
time, it lets loose a long blast.
